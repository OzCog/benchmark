Dataset notes
-------------
I was curious about what's in this dataset, and this directory
contains some notes about what I found.

===gene-paths.csv===
The number of triangle shaped paths for each gene.  When plotted
on a log-log graph, the distribution is clearly not Zipfian, except
maybe at the very beginning. The eyeballed fit is 1/sqrt(rank)
